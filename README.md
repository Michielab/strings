Hi!

This project is my first try with SVG. My goal was to make a string move and to play a sound when the string was touched. Once I had one string working I added a few more and decided to make a shape around it. I love the sound of a guitar, so I decided to make a guitar.

Check for yourself if it can pass for a guitar! :) https://michielab.github.io/strings/
