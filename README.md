Hi!

This project is my first try with SVG. My goal was to make a string move and to play a sound when it's touched.
When I had one string working I decided to make a guitar(at least I wanted to look a bit like a guitar.. :)).
If you want to give it a try, then just click on the following link https://michielab.github.io/strings/

have fun!
